You've probably seen the video about the guy who built an iPhone out of spare parts, you know his face but, who is he? I met up with him and we walked around the electronics markets talking about his upcoming projects, his channel and exactly who he is.Scotty's channel: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCO8DQrSp5yEP937qNqTooOw⚫ Watch Conquering Southern China (my documentary) and see China like no one outside of China has ever seen it before: https://vimeo.com/ondemand/conqueringsouthernchina⚫ Support me on Patreon: http://www.patreon.com/serpentzaJoin me on Facebook: http://www.facebook.com/winstoninchinaTwitter: @serpentzaInstagram: serpent_zaMy other channel: https://www.youtube.com/c/advchinaMusic used: Virtual Vice - E.
