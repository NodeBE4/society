You'll see young women coding, soldering and selling all sorts of technology in the tech markets of Mainland China, this is very different to the traditionally male dominated tech industry in the west. That isn't to say that women are not in the minority here, but they're a big part of the technology game, especially in China's silicon valley of hardware, Shenzhen. I meet up and speak to the most famous female Maker and Coder Naomi "SexyCyborg" Wu and we go for an adventure around China's biggest technology market. Come and join us to find out how women are holding up half the sky in the Chinese technology sector.Naomi's channel: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCh_ugKacslKhsGGdXP0cRRANaomi's twitter: @RealSexyCyborgMax's contact details: Email: max.ma@lexcent.comMobile: +8615889674711QQ: 2853753197M.J's contact details:Email: jeff88ai@163.comMobile: +8613713895188QQ: 1661331991C-milk's Hooters video:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQ4mSVB2CCUNaomi Wu (a pseudonym) is a Cantonese DIY maker who lives and works in Shenzhen, China; she is notable for her strong advocacy of women in STEM, transhumanism, open source, and body modifications, variously challenging both gender and tech stereotypes with her flamboyant public persona. She first came to public prominence on Reddit, where she has mostly male followers, and she maintains active Reddit and Twitter accounts under the noms de plume of SexyCyborg and RealSexyCyborg, respectively, as an internet personality. Professionally she is a web developer, coding in Ruby on Rails and JavaScript under a masculine pseudonym for overseas clients both for safety's sake and to preclude gender discrimination; she also reviews electronics. She regards "Chinese gadgets" as good as or better than foreign, and on International Women's Day 2017 she was listed as one of the 43 most influential women in 3D printing, a male-dominated field, by 3D Printer & 3D Printing News.⚫ Watch Conquering Southern China (my documentary) and see China like no one outside of China has ever seen it before: https://vimeo.com/ondemand/conqueringsouthernchina⚫ Support me on Patreon: http://www.patreon.com/serpentzaJoin me on Facebook: http://www.facebook.com/winstoninchinaTwitter: @serpentzaInstagram: serpent_zaMy other channel: https://www.youtube.com/c/advchinaMusic used: Virtual Vice - Sanctuary Runner Artist's bandcamp: https://new-world.bandcamp.com/album/off-duty
