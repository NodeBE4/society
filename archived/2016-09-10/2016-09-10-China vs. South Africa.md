South Africa is going into business with China, and since it is my home country, I figured it's time to compare the 2 countries with each other. South Africa is a culturally diverse, up and coming economy, with a lot to offer, but is also dangerous, and many Chinese who are doing business there are starting to see how dangerous it can be. After growing up in South Africa, and living in China for 10 years, I can draw a lot of similarities between the two countries, but also some stark differences.Worlds apart and culturally different, what is life like in these two strikingly unique countries?⚫ If you want to see China like no one outside of China has ever seen it before: https://vimeo.com/ondemand/conqueringsouthernchina⚫ CHINA MASS STABBINGS:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/School_attacks_in_China_(2010%E2%80%9312)https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2014_Kunming_attackhttp://www.mining.com/fifty-killed-in-a-knife-attack-at-a-chinese-colliery/http://edition.cnn.com/2016/02/29/asia/china-school-stabbings/⚫ My friend Nathan's channel: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCa2XAjd0xOcVJtfrtBKSM_Q⚫ Support me on Patreon: http://www.patreon.com/serpentzaJoin me on Facebook: http://www.facebook.com/winstoninchinaTwitter: @serpentzaInstagram: serpent_zaMusic used: Chicco - we can dance / FM84 - EverythingMy other channel: https://www.youtube.com/user/churchillcustoms
