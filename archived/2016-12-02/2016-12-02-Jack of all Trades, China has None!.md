China is a very interesting place. Labor is cheap, and that means that you can get most small tasks like fixing your toilet, or stitching your pants done for very little money. However, unlike in America, you cannot guarantee a good job. Often times Chinese people will cut corners, and this leads to a very scary situation at times.Chinese people tend to be very specialised, but I've never met a real Jack of all Trades in China...
