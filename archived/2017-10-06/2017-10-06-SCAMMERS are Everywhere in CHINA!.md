Traveller beware, China is a wonderful place to visit but you are very likely to get scammed, and not just the occasional traveller, everyone! Knowledge is Power, and even if you live here you have to be on your guard. Scamming is a part of daily life in one way or the other, but armed with this knowledge, you should be able to avoid the worst scams and have an amazing experience travelling throughout China.Collin’s video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qrc0kN7OCRE&feature=youtu.be⚫ Watch Conquering Southern China (my documentary) and see China like no one outside of China has ever seen it before: https://vimeo.com/ondemand/conqueringsouthernchina⚫ Support me on Patreon: http://www.patreon.com/serpentzaJoin me on Facebook: http://www.facebook.com/winstoninchinaTwitter: @serpentzaInstagram: serpent_zaMy other channel: https://www.youtube.com/c/advchinaMusic used: Kowloon City 2010Artist's bandcamp: https://new-world.bandcamp.com/album/off-duty
