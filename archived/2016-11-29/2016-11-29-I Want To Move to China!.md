I met with a subscriber in Utah who has visited China on a few occasions and he speaks about how much he would love to move to China, and the reasons why. In this video, you might find some useful information on whether or not you want to move to China too!A proper update on my American trip so far!⚫ If you want to see China like no one outside of China has ever seen it before: https://vimeo.com/ondemand/conqueringsouthernchina⚫ Support me on Patreon: http://www.patreon.com/serpentzaJoin me on Facebook: http://www.facebook.com/winstoninchinaTwitter: @serpentzaInstagram: serpent_zaMusic used: Michael Weber - It takes twoMy other channel: https://www.youtube.com/c/advchina
