China and Japan are two vastly different countries with a difficult past and history with each other. Both are super powers in Asia, but are very different in almost every way imaginable. I have lived in China for many years, and have had an active interest in Japan for most of my life, and now I have the chance to compare the two. The economy, shopping, electronics, traffic, politeness, culture, food, all of these things can be compared when speaking about these 2 nations.One Developing, one Developed. What are the differences between China and Japan?
