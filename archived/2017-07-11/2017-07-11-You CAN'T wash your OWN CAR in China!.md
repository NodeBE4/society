Washing your own car is something I grew up with, but in China you can't wash your own car! I've owned a car in China for over 7 years now and it's very different from owning a car in America or South Africa (I have owned cars in both countries), today I'll explain to you why it's just not possible to wash your own car in Mainland China.⚫ Watch Conquering Southern China (my documentary) and see China like no one outside of China has ever seen it before: https://vimeo.com/ondemand/conqueringsouthernchina⚫ Support me on Patreon: http://www.patreon.com/serpentzaJoin me on Facebook: http://www.facebook.com/winstoninchinaTwitter: @serpentzaInstagram: serpent_zaMy other channel: https://www.youtube.com/c/advchinaMusic used: Virtual Vice - City LimitsArtist's bandcamp: https://new-world.bandcamp.com/album/off-duty
