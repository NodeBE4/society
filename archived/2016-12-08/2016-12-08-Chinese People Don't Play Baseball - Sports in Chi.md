Basketball, badminton, ping pong - These are the sports that Chinese people love. NBA is more popular than in America. Nearly all boys are expected to enjoy basketball in China. However, the sports culture in China is very different than in America. There is no American football, baseball, or sitting around the sports bar watching the game.What sort of sports do Chinese people play and is it as big a part of Chinese society as it is in America?⚫ If you want to see China like no one outside of China has ever seen it before: https://vimeo.com/ondemand/conqueringsouthernchina⚫ Support me on Patreon: http://www.patreon.com/serpentzaJoin me on Facebook: http://www.facebook.com/winstoninchinaTwitter: @serpentzaInstagram: serpent_zaMusic used: VHS Dreams - DowntownMy other channel: https://www.youtube.com/c/advchina
