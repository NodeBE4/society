There's a guy in the middle of Oklahoma building a massive Chinese JUNK in his back yard! I had to go and check it out!My name is Doug Jackson.  I am the ambition and drive behind SV Seeker, but my success comes from knowing a lot of brilliant and skilled people who are drawn together around the sailboat Seeker.SV Seeker is not just a sailboat nor a yacht.  SV Seeker is a work boat and a dream and a tool for making dreams come true.   I’ve always wanted to do something grand and daring.   Something that filled my passions, not just the hours of my day or a bank account.   It started with building submarines, and with confidence it became building Seeker.   When completed I will have every skill I need to keep her in shape, and she will have the strength to take us to the wonders and treasures of the world’s oceans.Seeker will cater to adventurers, explorers, oceanographers, divers, wreck hunters, marine biologists and archaeologist and we will do it free of charge whenever possible.  If you want to be a part, then allow me to welcome you aboard.Our crew is forming now.  You can join the volunteers that are helping to build Seeker.  Sharpen your skills,  pass your skills onto others, learn new skills, build friendships and earn your passage onto Seeker when she is plying the waters off some sandy beaches in search of sunken treasure.Doug's Channel: https://www.youtube.com/user/submarineboat⚫ If you want to see China like no one outside of China has ever seen it before: https://vimeo.com/ondemand/conqueringsouthernchina⚫ Support me on Patreon: http://www.patreon.com/serpentzaJoin me on Facebook: http://www.facebook.com/winstoninchinaTwitter: @serpentzaInstagram: serpent_zaMusic used: Geisha X - Gentle MemoriesMy other channel: https://www.youtube.com/c/advchina
