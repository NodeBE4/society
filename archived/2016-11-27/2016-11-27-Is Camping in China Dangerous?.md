There's a massive Camping culture out here in the Sierra Nevada mountains, but what about China? Does China Camp? Can you camp in China? Over the years I have received a number of questions from people asking about camping in China. Most people are drawn to the adventure of it all but are scared away by the unknowns. Can it be done? Is it safe? Since there aren’t any official camping grounds in China, how is it possible to set up your tent here?⚫ If you want to see China like no one outside of China has ever seen it before: https://vimeo.com/ondemand/conqueringsouthernchina⚫ Support me on Patreon: http://www.patreon.com/serpentzaJoin me on Facebook: http://www.facebook.com/winstoninchinaTwitter: @serpentzaInstagram: serpent_zaMusic used: FM84 - EverythingMy other channel: https://www.youtube.com/c/advchina
