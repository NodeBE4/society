Visit the real situation of Chinese people's life. Now most Chinese people are living in deep water. Today's life is very difficult, coupled with the recent epidemic.

Most of the videos have subtitles or English subtitles. I don't have a gold owner. I haven't received advertisements. I'm not afraid to hurt others. So, what I said in the videos is true.
