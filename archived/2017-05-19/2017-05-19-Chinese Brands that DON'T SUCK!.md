"Made in China" usually means that it's not going to last or that the build quality can be expected to be sub-par or poor. However there are companies in China that are starting to break that stereotype! Come with me to China's Silicon Valley and see some of China's home-grown brands that are shaking off the image that "Made in China" means "Junk".Huaqiangbei (Chinese: 华强北; pinyin: Huáqiángběi; literally: "Huaqiang North") is an area and subdistrict of Futian, Shenzhen, Guangdong Province, China. The area's status as a major electronics manufacturing hub, and sprawling electronics marketplaces have earned it (and Shenzhen) occidental nicknames such as "China's Silicon Valley", and the "Silicon Valley of Hardware".The subdistrict runs from Shennan Road at SEG Plaza near Huaqiang Road Station of the Shenzhen Metro for 1 kilometre (0.62 mi) north to the Pavilion Hotel. It is at the spine of a shopping district, with cross streets Zhenzhong Road (振中路), Zhenhua Road (振华路) and Zhenxing Road (振兴路). Huafa Road (华发路) is immediately parallel to the east with Yannan Road (燕南路) further away. The central area of the district is along Huaqiang Road (华强路), a busy pedestrian street which the district is named after.The area is characterized by tree-lined streets with wide (5 to 20 metres (16 to 66 ft)) footpaths. Huaqiangbei is famous for its variety of electronics and clothing shops, though it has a notorious history of selling counterfeit and smuggled goods⚫ Watch Conquering Southern China (my documentary) and see China like no one outside of China has ever seen it before: https://vimeo.com/ondemand/conqueringsouthernchina⚫ Support me on Patreon: http://www.patreon.com/serpentzaJoin me on Facebook: http://www.facebook.com/winstoninchinaTwitter: @serpentzaInstagram: serpent_zaMy other channel: https://www.youtube.com/c/advchinaMusic used: Virtual Vice - Kowloon City 2100Artist's bandcamp: https://virtual-vice.bandcamp.com/releases
