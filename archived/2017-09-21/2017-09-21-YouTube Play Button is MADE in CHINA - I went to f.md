Let's go find the factory together!YouTube Play Buttons, a part of the YouTube Creator Rewards, care a recognition by YouTube of its most popular channels.These are distinct from the YouTube Awards which are intended to recognize the best quality videos, while the YouTube Creator Rewards are based solely on a channel's subscriber count.AwardsWhen a verified YouTuber reaches a specific milestone, they are awarded a relatively flat trophy in a metal casing with a YouTube play button symbol. The trophies are of different sizes: each button and plaque get progressively bigger the more subscribers the channel gets.There are currently three levels of rewards, plus a fourth one that has been awarded to only one YouTuber thus far:YouTube Silver Play Button - The Silver Play Button, for channels that surpass 100,000 subscribers. Old version made of nickel plated copper-nickel alloy.YouTube Gold Play Button - The Gold Play Button, for channels that surpass 1,000,000 subscribers. Made of golden plated brass.YouTube Diamond Play Button - The Diamond Play Button, for channels that surpass 10,000,000 subscribers.

It was made in the shape of his channel's logo. It is not referenced in the Creators Award page and it is unknown if such a trophy will be given out to any other YouTuber who surpasses the milestone in the future.⚫ Watch Conquering Southern China (my documentary) and see China like no one outside of China has ever seen it before: https://vimeo.com/ondemand/conqueringsouthernchina⚫ Support me on Patreon: http://www.patreon.com/serpentzaJoin me on Facebook: http://www.facebook.com/winstoninchinaTwitter: @serpentzaInstagram: serpent_zaMy other channel: https://www.youtube.com/c/advchinaMusic used: Virtual Vice - City LimitsArtist's bandcamp: https://new-world.bandcamp.com/album/off-duty
