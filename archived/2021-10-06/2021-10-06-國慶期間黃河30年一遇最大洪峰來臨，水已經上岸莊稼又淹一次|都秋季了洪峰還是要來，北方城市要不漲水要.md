Visit the real situation of Chinese people's life. Now most Chinese people are living in deep water. Today's life is very difficult, coupled with the recent epidemic. The economy has been on the decline, and now it has become even worse. The video is shot by mobile phones, with average picture quality I'm sorry. Most of the videos have subtitles or English subtitles. I don't have a gold owner. I haven't received advertisements. I'm not afraid to hurt others. So, what I said in the videos is true.Welcome to subscribe to me, if you have any questions, please leave a message below. Thank you for your support!UndecoratedChina
